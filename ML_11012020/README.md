# Pandas and Scikit-learn Revision

## IDE choice is very important so let pick one
- You can Google "Best IDE for Python" so there will a bunch of suggestions that you can use
- I do go "bottom-up" so I chose light weight IDEs such as 
  - IDLE  - don't recommend since I think you know why :grimacing:
  - Spyder
  - Thonny
  - [Pyscripter](https://softfamous.com/portable-pyscripter/) - This one is a bit straight forward so you must install the right OS base for it
  - [PyDev](https://www.pydev.org/download.html)
