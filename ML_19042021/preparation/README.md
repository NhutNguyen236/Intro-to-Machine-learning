# Preparation for `CNN` (theory)

- CNN is a special case of a neural network with an input layer, output layer and multiple hidden layers. 
- The hidden layers have 4 different procedures to complete the network.

## Step to perform
The 3 principal layers of CNN are:

    - Convolution
    - Pooling or Resampling
    - Flatten, Fully Connected, and Softmax Layers

Activation function
- Non-linear(ReLU)

- Backpropagation: Training the Neural Network

## Function of each layer
- Convolution => Feature Map - f.map 
- Pooling => decrease dimensionality of f.map 
- Fully Connected =>  Turn pooling result to 1D feature vector

## Model in used 
- CNN algorithms were a huge breakthrough in the field of computer vision
