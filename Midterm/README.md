# WELCOME TO MIDTERM FOLDER

- This shall be a good place for you to find my midterm attempt for a basic natural language processing implementation :tada:
- I should keep the intro short, let's get it begin 

## :bookmark: Objectives
Crawl data from vnexpress (at least 5 topic, 40 documents/1 topic)

Output:  
-  Pre processing (stopword, html,tokenizeâ€¦)
Extract TF-IDF feature
Using SVM for training of document classification
Evaluate by Accuracy

## :bookmark: Objective evaluation 
- [] Crawl data from Vnexpress from 5 topics, 40 docs/topic
- [] Data pre processing
- [] Extract model using TF-IDF feature
- [] Using SVM for training of document classification
- [] Evaluate by Accuracy

## :question: How I started? 
- Look, as a dummy in Machine Learning, I do read the books first and things that read are all in `Books` folder

## :question: Crawling data from a website - VnExpress
